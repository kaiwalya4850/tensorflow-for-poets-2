# Overview

This repo contains code for the "TensorFlow for poets 2" series of codelabs.

I am making various changes to the main repo, so that it becomes more seemless than it already is!

I would recommend you to follow tf for poets on tf2.

# Contains:
##### code to know input/output layer of your model(some people have question about what to put in input_layer, Mul, Placeholder or input_layer. I have coded to sort that.
##### code to convert to .tflite file. Existing tensorflow has lot of issues of bazel, toco etc. The code provided is tested and can convert .pb to .tflite easily
##### code to check output on .pb files as well as on .tflite files.
##### code to test your outputs in realtime on webcam via .tflite file.(requires tf2)
