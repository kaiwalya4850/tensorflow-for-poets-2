# Overview

This repo contains code for the "TensorFlow for poets 2" series of codelabs.

I am making various changes to the main repo, so that it becomes more seemless than it already is!

The only main requirement here is to use Tensorflow version 1.15.0(Since I dont own any Nvidia GPU, i cant comment on it)

The main change I'll try to bring is to detect the objects in realtime or video, than just images.
